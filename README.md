- This app also displays a 5 Day forecast for the city entered, including the following information:
  - Date
  - Weather Icon
  - Hight Temperature
  - Low Temperature
  - Humidity

-  Outstanding Issues:
  - Interaction with local storage (Storing which cities have been searched)
  - Using the geolocation API to automatically get user's location
  - cosmetic issues
