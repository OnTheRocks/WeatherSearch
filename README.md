# WeatherSearch
This is an app that searches for the current weather as well as a 5 day forecast using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## About

- The user will enter a city and click the search button.  The app will return current 
  weather information for that city.  That information includes: 
  - A weather icon depicting the current conditions
  - High Temperature
  - Low Temperature
  - Humidity 
  - Wind Speed
  - UV Index

- This app also displays a 5 Day forecast for the city entered, including the following information:
  - Date
  - Weather Icon
  - Hight Temperature
  - Low Temperature
  - Humidity

-  Outstanding Issues:
  - Interaction with local storage (Storing which cities have been searched)
  - Using the geolocation API to automatically get user's location
  - cosmetic issues
